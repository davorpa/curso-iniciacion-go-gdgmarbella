### How to use
The repo is organized in four branches:

| Session |    Branch   |                          Comment                         |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1st   | concurrence |             Basics and concurrent programming            |
|   2nd   |     http    |     HTTP: Client, Server, TLS. Testing HTTP Services     |
|   3rd   |   net  |            The main utilities and objects in the net package |                                              |
|   4th   |   proyect   | The final proyect where you can try the concepts learned |

### Caveats
This is a fast-forward course, so it's a good idea to previously know something about the language syntax and basic features. The best places to start in my opinion is [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) or [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
