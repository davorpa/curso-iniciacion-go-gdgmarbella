# GDG Marbella - GO Course katas

Some katas to know something about the language syntax and basic features provided by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) website.

## How to use

To run the program, put the code in a `.go` file and use `go run` command.

```
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world
```

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using `go build`.

```
$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world    hello-world.go
```

We can then execute the built binary directly.

```
$ ./hello-world
hello world
```
